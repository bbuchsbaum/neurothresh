Statistical thresholding for neuroimaging data using Likelihood-Ratio
Matched-Filter Thresholding (LR-MFT) with hierarchical stepdown
inference. Provides theoretically superior alternative to traditional
GRF/RFT methods for detecting spatially extended activations. Includes
baseline implementations (RFT, TFCE, cluster-FDR) for comparison.
