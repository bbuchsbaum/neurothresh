\title{Recursive octree split}
\usage{
octree_split(indices, x, y, z, min_voxels = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{indices}{Integer vector of mask-space indices}

\item{x}{Integer vector of x coordinates (mask-space)}

\item{y}{Integer vector of y coordinates (mask-space)}

\item{z}{Integer vector of z coordinates (mask-space)}

\item{min_voxels}{Minimum region size to continue splitting}
}
\value{
List of index vectors for leaf regions
}
\description{
Recursively partitions a region into octree children until
regions are smaller than min_voxels.
