\title{Estimate Gaussian ACF FWHM from a single map (map-only)}
\usage{
estimate_fwhm_vox(
  z_vol,
  mask = NULL,
  clip = 3,
  isotropic = FALSE,
  z_trim = 1.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{z_vol}{3D volume-like object.}

\item{mask}{Optional logical mask aligned to \code{z_vol}. If NULL, uses
\code{is.finite(as.numeric(z_vol))}.}

\item{clip}{Clip value applied to \code{z_vol} prior to taking \code{sign},
to reduce sensitivity to large outliers (default 3).}

\item{isotropic}{Logical; if TRUE, returns a single averaged FWHM replicated
over x/y/z.}

\item{z_trim}{If not NULL, restricts estimation to voxels with
\code{|Z| <= z_trim} (default 1.5) as a heuristic to reduce contamination
from true signal when only a single statistic map is available.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector length 3: estimated \code{fwhm_vox} in voxel units.
}
\description{
Map-only smoothness estimator based on robust sign correlations at short lags.
This assumes approximate stationarity and that signal occupies a relatively
small fraction of the mask.
}
\details{
This estimates an effective stationary smoothness parameter from the
statistic field itself (not from residuals). It is intended for
model-based Monte Carlo calibration when subject-level/residual resampling
is not available.
